                  We collect personal information directly when you provide it

                  through other people when you use services associated with the

                  As the operator of digital content marketplaces, we have a
                  legitimate interest in verifying the identity of our authors.
                  We believe that knowing who our authors are will strengthen
                  the integrity of our marketplaces by reducing fraud, making
                  authors more accountable for their content and giving Envato
                  and customers the ability to enforce contracts for authors who
                  break the rules. Envato also has certain legal obligations
                  that require us to know who our authors are in certain
                  circumstances. In light of this, if you are an author we will
                  verify your identity, in particular, your name, full address
                  and date of birth by asking you to show us a Photo ID
                  document. The verification procedure is called Envato Verify.
                  Envato Verify will be carried out by our service provider
                  Jumio Corporation located at 395 Page Mill Road, Suite 150,
                  Palo Alto, California, USA. As part of Envato Verify, you will
                  be asked to take a selfie which will then be compared against
                  your Photo ID document using facial recognition technology. We
                  will use your Photo ID document solely to carry out Envato
                  Verify and delete it after the completion of this process.

                      third party service providers (like Google, Facebook) who

                      about you when you link, connect, or login to your account
                      with the third party provider and they send us information
                      such as your registration and profile from that service,
                      this only occurs if you are using Envato Studio. The
                      information varies and is controlled by that service
                      provider or as authorized by you via your privacy settings

                      other third party sources/and or partners from Australia,
                      US or UK, whereby we receive additional information about
                      you (to the extent permitted by applicable law), such as
                      demographic data or fraud detection information, and
                      combine it with information we have about you. For
                      example, fraud warnings from service providers like
                      identity verification service. We also receive information
                      about you and your activities on and off the Envato
                      platform through partnerships, or about your experiences

                      receive information about you as a rights holder from our
                      third party authors. For example, information in the form
